Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is characterized by reduced kidney function or evidence of kidney damage.
Elevated serum creatinine is a key indicator of impaired kidney filtration.
Low hemoglobin levels are commonly associated with anemia in CKD patients.
Hypertension is a major risk factor for CKD progression.
Early detection and monitoring are critical to slow disease progression.
